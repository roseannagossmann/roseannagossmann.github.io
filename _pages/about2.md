    excerpt: "I earned my PhD in Mathematics from Tulane University in New Orleans in May 2018, where I studied under the direction of Dr. Lisa Fauci. My research interests include computational biofluid dynamics, modeling elastic bodies and fluid-elastic interactions, deformation of collapsible tubes, stokes flow, and female reproductive health, as well as mathematical biology and computational mathematics more generally. I applied these in my doctoral research exploring the elastohydrodynamics of a simplified human birth model.
	
	Originally hailing from rural northern California, I completed my undergraduate studies in Mathematics and Biology with a special emphasis on Education at Humboldt State University and Mills College. I am passionate about math education and have a background in teaching advanced students at math circles and other extracurricular programs, as well as working with public high school students in math and biology."
